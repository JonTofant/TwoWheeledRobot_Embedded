"""NN drive task configuration: joystick-commanded balancing/driving with terrain.

Extends the pure NN balance task with:
  - velocity + yaw-rate commands (joystick contract, integrated pos/yaw references),
  - 6-dim actions (4 CyberGear stance targets + 2 DDSM115 wheel currents),
  - generated terrain (flat / small bumps / inclines) for sim2real driving,
  - much wider domain randomization (mass, COM, odometry scale, gyro bias,
    IMU mounting bias, CyberGear gains).

Observation and action layout are documented in DriveObservationBuilder in
pure_nn_components.py and in STM32_DEPLOYMENT.md — keep them aligned with the
STM32 firmware when editing.

    # NNDrive uses "contact" (2026-08-07). The tilt rule was not measuring falling:
    # with the COM range fixed, relaxing it from 25 deg to 80 deg took stage-1
    # termination from 14-20% to exactly 0% across all three scenarios with full
    # 15 s survival — i.e. every "fall" was a recovery swing overshooting 25 deg,
    # not the robot going down. A leaning robot is not a fallen robot, and 0 deg
    # pitch is not even a well-defined target when the IMU carries a mounting
    # bias, so attitude is no longer a termination criterion at all. It is shaped
    # by reward only (see rew_pitch_band / rew_roll_band).
    #
    # The sensor deliberately covers ALL bodies, not just the non-wheel ones: the
    # wheel channels are the runtime proof that contact reporting is actually on
    # (robot_cfg.py activate_contact_sensors). Non-wheel bodies are selected in
    # code via find_bodies, not by excluding wheels in this regex.
    # NOTE: "contact" is implemented, verified and evidenced as the better fall
    # definition (relaxing the tilt rule 25 -> 80 deg took stage-1 termination
    # from 14-20% to 0% with full survival, i.e. every "fall" it reported was a
    # recovery swing). It is NOT the default, because it is coupled to the
    # reward: with penalty-based shaping a robot that can sit past 25 deg
    # indefinitely accrues sustained negative reward, and diving becomes
    # optimal. Enabling it needs the attitude penalties re-bounded in the same

    # construction. The property held, but it multiplied per-step reward by ~9
    # (1.3 -> 11.6), Train/mean_reward by ~15x and Loss/value_function by ~80x,
    # while value_loss_coef and desired_kl stayed where they were tuned for the
    # old scale. The adaptive-KL schedule then stopped converging: the learning
    # rate oscillated across its whole 1e-5..1e-2 range on every seed and sat at
    # the ceiling late in training, so policies got WORSE with more iterations

    # Persistent trim errors are the direct cause of "drives away": a constant
    # offset between the measured zero-pitch and the true balance point makes a
    # pitch-servoing policy accelerate forever. The only cure is for the policy
    # to learn to re-trim from pos_err/velocity, which it only learns if the
    # offsets in training are big enough to matter. Widened from +-1.5 cm /
    # +-1.2 deg, which real COM tolerance and BNO080 mounting easily exceed.
    #
    # RENAMED FROM com_offset_x_range_m 2026-08-05. It was applied to coms[..., 0]
    # = X, which is the LATERAL axis (confirmed against the USD world frame:
    # Y is fore/aft, X is sideways lean, Z is yaw). The trim error described
    # above is a fore/aft quantity — it moves the pitch balance point — so it
    # belongs on Y. Consequences of the transposition: the "drives away" trim
    # randomization this comment justifies had never actually trained, and a
    # +-3 cm sideways COM offset was instead perturbing roll, on an axis the
    # policy could not even observe before 1e20e5f. Same class of bug as the
    # transposed disturbance-force axes fixed in e518082, missed in that pass.
    # The lateral offset is dropped rather than kept: it was never intended, and
    # +-3 cm off-centre is a large payload asymmetry to demand.
    #
    # NARROWED +-30 mm -> +-5 mm on 2026-08-07 (docs/experiments/2026-08-07). Once
    # the axis was fixed, +-30 mm became the single dominant cause of stage-1
    # falls: separation analysis over 26 randomized parameters put
    # abs(com_offset_y) at Cohen's d = 0.999 / AUC = 0.758 with nothing else above
    # d = 0.29, and fall rate rose monotonically 13% -> 79% across its range.
    # The arithmetic: Platform_Group is 59.7% of the robot's 3.80 kg, so a
    # platform COM shift d moves the whole-robot COM by 0.597*d, and the measured
    # trim sensitivity is 0.758 deg of permanent lean per mm of whole-robot
    # offset. That comes from the COM height above the wheel axis, measured
    # directly at 75.63 mm by scripts/measure_nominal_com.py -- an earlier
    # estimate of ~93 mm backed out from observed trim was 25% high, so figures
    # derived from it understated every trim demand. So +-30 mm demanded +-13.3
    # deg of permanent lean against a 25 deg fall threshold.
    # +-5 mm -> +-3.0 mm whole-robot -> +-2.3 deg, which sits just below the
    # +-3 deg IMU mounting bias -- the right ordering, since that bias is
