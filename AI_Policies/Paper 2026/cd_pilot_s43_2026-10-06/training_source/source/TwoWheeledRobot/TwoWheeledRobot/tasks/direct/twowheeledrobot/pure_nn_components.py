    ``yaw_err`` changed from a single clamped radian to an unclamped sin/cos
    pair 2026-08-10 (renumbering [4] onward -- this repo's firmware is still
    ours to define, so this trades the previous "indices 0-17 keep their
    meaning, append only" convention for actually fixing the representation).
    The old approach clamped yaw_err to +-cmd_yaw_err_clamp_rad via reference
    anti-windup (CommandGenerator._apply_reference_anti_windup used to handle
    yaw the same way it still handles position): needed both to keep the
    observation bounded and to avoid the raw wrapped error sweeping past +-pi,
    a step discontinuity in the "which way to turn" signal that measured 100%
    fall rate at a sustained 1.2 rad/s command. sin/cos of the RAW (unwrapped)
    difference solves both at once -- it is smooth and bounded in [-1, 1] for
    any error magnitude, with no wrap point to hit regardless of how far
    yaw_ref runs ahead of an unachievable command -- so the anti-windup on
    yaw_ref was removed rather than reused for a heading-drift patch. Unlike
    pos_err (which stays reward-only for world drift -- position is unbounded
    AND has no absolute real-world sensor, only drifting wheel odometry), yaw
    needed neither a clamp nor a privileged-reward workaround once encoded
    this way: it is bounded by construction (periodic) and, on this robot's
    BNO085, an actually measurable quantity, not a dead-reckoned one. yaw
    itself carries no simulated noise/bias (see _get_observations), matching a
    fused-IMU heading rather than raw gyro integration.

    Roll and roll_rate ([19]/[20]) were added 2026-08-04, appended after
    pitch/pitch_rate rather than grouped next to them so the firmware change
    was two extra values rather than a renumbering -- the convention the yaw
    change above deliberately breaks from, for reasons explained there. Before
    roll/roll_rate existed the reward penalized roll at
    rew_roll = 12.0 -- the heaviest weight in the config -- while roll was
    absent from this vector, so the policy was taxed on a quantity it could not
    sense while holding four leg actuators that directly control it. Measured
    consequence: roll left the reset value of 0.000 deg and settled to a
    systematic lean within 1.5 s, identical in sign and magnitude across all
    envs and unaffected by command, disturbance or terrain (-5.3 deg for the
    2026-07-29 policy, -11.0 deg for 2026-08-04). With zero actions the
    platform sits level, confirming the lean was policy-commanded.

    previous design bounded each penalty against the ~2.3/step a fall forfeits;
    that argument had already failed once (docs/experiments/2026-07-28: an
    unbounded wrapped-yaw penalty reached 4.9/step and turn-in-place fell 98% of
    the time) and had to be re-derived every time a weight moved.

    Shapes, both module-level helpers:

    * ``tent_bonus`` — steepest at zero error, linear to zero at ``max_error``.
      Replaces the old ``-w*e^2`` penalties and keeps the restoring gradient that
      closes out the last few cm/s, which an exp kernel (flat at zero) cannot.
    * ``flat_top_bonus`` — full weight inside a band with no gradient, decaying
      outside. Used for pitch and roll.

    Attitude is a band rather than a target because the reward reads *true*
    pitch/roll while the policy observes a copy carrying a per-episode mounting
    bias (+-3 deg pitch, +-1 deg roll). Demanding an exact angle inside that band
    asks the policy to resolve what its sensor cannot, and trains a precision the
    hardware IMU can never deliver. Attitude is also no longer a termination
    criterion — falling is contact-based (see NNDriveEnvCfg.fall_mode) — so the
    3-to-15 deg shoulder is the only thing keeping the robot vertical.
