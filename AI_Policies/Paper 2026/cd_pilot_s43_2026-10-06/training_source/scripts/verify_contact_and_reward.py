"""Assert the contact sensor is live and the reward is non-negative.

Both properties fail silently if they fail at all, which is why they get their
own script rather than a comment:

* ``activate_contact_sensors=False`` does not raise — a ContactSensor built on
  top of it reports zeros forever, so every episode looks contact-free and
  nothing ever terminates. Wheel forces are the tell: they must be non-zero
  while the robot is standing on them.
* The reward's ">= 0 in every reachable state" invariant is what makes diving for
  the floor unable to pay. Nothing enforces it at runtime, so it is checked here
  against real rollouts including deliberately tipped states.

Exits non-zero if any check fails.
